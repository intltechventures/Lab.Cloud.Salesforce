  	* "Application events follow a traditional publish-subscribe model. An application event is fired from an instance of a component. All components that provide a handler for the event are notified."

	  * "The framework supports capture, bubble, and default phases for the propagation of application events. The capture and bubble phases are similar to DOM handling patterns and provide an opportunity for interested components to interact with an event and potentially control the behavior for subsequent handlers. The default phase preserves the frameworkâ€™s original handling behavior."
